# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

VtsServing is currently under active development and releases a new version
every 2-3 weeks. We always recommend users to move to a newer version
when it became available, and we only provide security updates in the 
latest version.

If you are using an older version of VtsServing and would like to receive
security patches, let us know via
[VtsServing Slack Channel](https://join.slack.vtsserving.org)
or [VtsServing Discussions](https://github.com/vtsserving/VtsServing/discussions).


## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please do not share it publicly on GitHub
nor the community slack channel. Instead, contact the VtsServing team
directly via email first: contact@vtsserving.ai
